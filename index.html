    New FIA Regulations to Combat 'Porpoising' for the 2023 Formula One Season

  <!-- Porpoising Explanation -->
  <h2> <br>
    Porpoising: What is it?
  </br> </h2>
  <p>
    Porpoising is an aerodynamic phenomenon caused by the 2022 F1 car design,
    which intended to create more downforce and has created a side effect known as
    porpoising. It has been seen affecting many drivers and cars, causing discomfort
    for drivers. Porpoising can actually be tuned out of the car, however this will
    result in loss in performance.

  <p><br>
    How did porpoising begin? Well, in the aftermath of a car, 
    there is turbulent, "dirty" air. 
    This contaminated air makes it challenging for a motorist in 
    pursuit to come close, maintain speed, and pass the leading 
    vehicle. The 2022 car design regulations implemented several
    structural modifications to encourage closer racing and more
    precise passing.

  <p>
    Some structural changes included a wider front wing, over-wheel winglets and tunnels
    underneath the chassis floor. This brought the unexpected side effect of porpoising. 
    Porpoising occurs when a car's downforce draws it so close to the
    ground at high speeds that it obstructs airflow and causes an abrupt loss of
    downforce. As this cycle repeats, the suspension pulls the car back up,
    causing it to bounce.

  <!-- The FIA Solution -->
  <h2>
    The (FIA) Solution
  </h2>

  <p>
    After several driver complaints regarding porpoising, the FIA has decided to take action.
    The organisation first implemented a technical directive, specifically directive TD039, which
    allows the FIA to monitor vertical accelerations and place limits on the levels of these
    accelerations (technical directives are a form of rules that are typically discussed mainly
    among teams). From the Belgian Grand  Prix, the FIA will keep vertical accelerations of cars
    underneath a microscope and take action against any vehicles considered to be 'extreme'. However, 
    they haven't precisely specified yet what 'extreme' or acceptable levels of vertical accelerations are.
  </p>

  <p>
    Strengthening an existing technical regulation is one of the essential components of this 
    technical directive. Each Formula One car has a hardwood plank installed on the floor of 
    the cars, and that plank's flexibility is strictly controlled. There was a rumour that 
    numerous teams had been experimenting this plank's flexibility by deviating from the 
    permitted 3mm deflection. Throughout the season, the FIA will continue to look into 
    this speculation.
