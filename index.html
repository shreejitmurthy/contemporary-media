  <h1>New FIA Regulations to Combat Porpoising for the 2023 Formula One Season</h1>

  <!-- Porpoising Explanation -->
  <h2> <br>Porpoising: What is it?</br> </h2>
  <p>Porpoising is an aerodynamic phenomenon caused by the 2022 F1 car design,
    which intended to create more downforce and has created a side effect known as
    porpoising. It has been seen affecting many drivers and cars, causing discomfort
    for drivers. Porpoising can actually be tuned out of the car, however this will
    result in loss in performance. </p>

  <p><br>How did porpoising begin? Well, in the aftermath of a car, 
    there is turbulent, "dirty" air. 
    This contaminated air makes it challenging for a motorist in 
    pursuit to come close, maintain speed, and pass the leading 
    vehicle. The 2022 car design regulations implemented several
    structural modifications to encourage closer racing and more
    precise passing.</br></p>

  <p>Some of the structural changes included a wider front wing, over-wheel winglets and tunnels
    underneath the floor of the chassis. This brought the unexpected side effect of porpoising. 
    Porpoising occurs when a car's downforce draws it so close to the
    ground at high speeds that it obstructs airflow and causes an abrupt loss of
    downforce. As this cycle repeats, the suspension pulls the car back up,
    causing it to bounce.
