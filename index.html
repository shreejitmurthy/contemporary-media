  <h1>New FIA Regulations to Combat Porpoising for the 2023 Formula One Season</h1>
  <h3>Writer: Shree Murthy</h3>
  <p><br>Porpoising is an aerodynamic phenomenon caused by the 2022 F1 car design,
    which intended to create more downforce and has created a side effect known as
    porpoising. Porpoising occurs when a car's downforce draws it so close to the
    ground at high speeds that it obstructs airflow and causes an abrupt loss of
    downforce. As this cycle repeats, the suspension pulls the automobile back up,
    causing it to bounce.</br></p>
