    New FIA Regulations to Combat 'Porpoising' for the 2023 Formula One Season

  <!-- Porpoising Explanation -->
  <h2> <br>
    Porpoising: What is it?
  </br> </h2>
  <p>
    Porpoising is an aerodynamic phenomenon caused by the 2022 F1 car design,
    which intended to create more downforce and has created a side effect known as
    porpoising. It has been seen affecting many drivers and cars, causing discomfort
    for drivers. Porpoising can actually be tuned out of the car, however this will
    result in loss in performance.

  <p><br>
    How did porpoising begin? Well, in the aftermath of a car, 
    there is turbulent, "dirty" air. 
    This contaminated air makes it challenging for a motorist in 
    pursuit to come close, maintain speed, and pass the leading 
    vehicle. The 2022 car design regulations implemented several
    structural modifications to encourage closer racing and more
    precise passing.
  </br></p>

  <p>
    Some structural changes included a wider front wing, over-wheel winglets and tunnels
    underneath the chassis floor. This brought the unexpected side effect of porpoising. 
    Porpoising occurs when a car's downforce draws it so close to the
    ground at high speeds that it obstructs airflow and causes an abrupt loss of
    downforce. As this cycle repeats, the suspension pulls the car back up,
    causing it to bounce.
  </p>

  <!-- The FIA Solution -->
  <h2>
    The (FIA) Solution
  </h2>

  <p>
    After several driver complaints regarding porpoising, the World Motorsport Council (FIA)
    has decided to take action. The organisation first implemented a technical directive, 
    specifically directive TD039, which
    allows the FIA to monitor vertical accelerations and place limits on the levels of these
    accelerations (technical directives are a form of rules that are typically discussed mainly
    among teams). From the Belgian Grand  Prix, the FIA will keep vertical accelerations of cars
    underneath a microscope and take action against any vehicles considered to be 'extreme'. However, 
    they haven't exactly specified yet what 'extreme' or acceptable levels of vertical accelerations are.
  </p>

  <p>
    Strengthening an existing technical regulation is one of the essential components of this 
    technical directive. Each Formula One car has a hardwood plank installed on the floor of 
    the cars, and that plank's flexibility is strictly controlled. There was a rumour that 
    numerous teams had been experimenting this plank's flexibility by deviating from the 
    permitted 2mm deflection. Throughout the season, the FIA will continue to look into 
    this speculation.

  </i></p>

  <p>
    One of the significant changes in next year's technical regulations is regarding the 
    Formula One car's floor edges, which are being raised by 25mm. This visibly minor 
    change could affect a lot of things next season. Raising the floor edges is a 
    significant disadvantage. Every team tries to run the car as close to the 
    ground because it generates more downforce, thus holding an aerodynamic 
    advantage. However, the FIA has not yet approved this rule modification, 
    so it is possible that it will alter.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are some other significant changes based on the floor of the car, 
    in the throat of the diffuser, where the air is driven in to create downforce. 
    The FIA are making that shape slightly larger and raising it. This change makes 
    the diffuser less effective and reduces the overall downforce, making the car 
    slower but reducing porpoising in theory.

  <p>
    On top of all that, the FIA will have a covert operative in the driver's seat 
    the following year. Under the driver's seat, the current vertical acceleration sensor will be 
    swapped out for a new, more precise sensor. The new sensor will assist the 
    FIA in better monitoring vertical accelerations and defining what is and is not allowed.
