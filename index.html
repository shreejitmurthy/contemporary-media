  <h1>
    New FIA Regulations to Combat 'Porpoising' for the 2023 Formula 1 Season
  </h1>

  <!-- Porpoising Explanation -->
  <h2> <br>
    Porpoising: What is it?
  </br> </h2>
  <p>
    Porpoising is an aerodynamic phenomenon caused by the 2022 F1 car design,
    which intended to create more downforce and has created a side effect known as
    porpoising. It has been seen affecting many drivers and cars, causing discomfort
    for drivers.

  </i></p>

  <p><br>
    How did porpoising begin? Well, in the aftermath of a car,
    there is turbulent, "dirty" air.
    This contaminated air makes it challenging for a motorist in
    pursuit to come close, maintain speed, and pass the leading
    vehicle. The 2022 car design regulations implemented several
    structural modifications to encourage closer racing and more
    precise passing.
  </br></p>

  <p>
    Some structural changes included a wider front wing, over-wheel winglets and tunnels
    underneath the chassis floor. This brought the unexpected side effect of porpoising.
    Porpoising occurs when a car's downforce draws it so close to the
    ground at high speeds that it obstructs airflow and causes an abrupt loss of
    downforce. As this cycle repeats, the suspension pulls the car back up,
    causing it to bounce.
  </p>

  <!-- The FIA Solution -->
  <h2>
    The FIA Solution
  </h2>

  <p>
    After several driver complaints regarding porpoising, the World Motorsport Council (FIA)
    has decided to take action. The organisation first implemented a technical directive,
    specifically directive TD039, which
    allows the FIA to monitor vertical oscillations and place limits on the levels of these
    oscillations, (technical directives are a form of rules that are typically discussed mainly
    among teams), which is the amount of times the car bounces.
    From the Belgian Grand  Prix, the FIA will keep vertical oscillations of cars
    underneath a microscope and take action against any vehicles considered to be 'extreme'. However,
    they haven't exactly specified yet what 'extreme' or acceptable levels of vertical oscillations are.
  </p>

  <p>
    Strengthening an existing technical regulation is one of the essential components of this
    technical directive. Each Formula 1 car has a hardwood plank installed on the floor of
    the cars, and that plank's flexibility is strictly controlled. There was a rumour that
    numerous teams had been experimenting this plank's flexibility by deviating from the
    permitted 2mm deflection. Throughout the season, the FIA will continue to look into
    this speculation.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 14px"><i>

  </i></p>

  <p>
    One of the significant changes in next year's technical regulations is regarding the
    Formula 1 car's floor edges, which are being raised by 25mm. This visibly minor
    change could affect a lot of things next season. Raising the floor edges is a
    significant disadvantage. Every team tries to run the car as close to the
    ground because it generates more downforce, thus holding an aerodynamic
    advantage. However, the FIA has not yet approved this rule modification,
    so it is possible that it will alter.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are some other significant changes based on the floor of the car,
    in the throat of the diffuser, where the air is driven in to create downforce.
    The FIA are making that shape slightly larger and raising it. This change makes
    the diffuser less effective and reduces the overall downforce, making the car
    slower but reducing porpoising in theory.
  </p>

  </i></p>


  <p>
    On top of all that, the FIA will have a covert operative in the cockpit
    the following year. Under the driver's seat, the current vertical acceleration sensor will be
    swapped out for a new, more precise sensor. The new sensor will assist the
    FIA in better monitoring vertical accelerations and defining what is and is not allowed.
  </p>

  <!-- New Rule Effect on Teams -->
  <h2>
    Regulation Inequity?
  </h2>

  <p>
    So, how will these new regulations affect teams? Mercedes, a team with experienced
    porpoising in full effect, will presumably find these new FIA rules advantageous.
    However, what of a team who hasn't experienced much porpoising? These new rules,
    however, seem more in favour of Mercedes, who have been vocal in anticipation of
    the FIA enacting regulations to conceivably level the playing field concerning the
    vehicles' porpoising on straights. Guenther Steiner, the team principal of Haas F1
    Team, stated <i><q>You change something fundamentally, and it could change the pecking
    order completely. Is that really fair?</q></i>. Steiner holds a point; not every team
    experienced much porpoising, and some developed their car to eliminate it.
  </p>

  <img src="media/verstappen_redbull.jpeg" height="480" width="720">
  <p style="font-size: 14px"><i>

    Bahrain (FORMULA 1, 2022b)
  </i></p>

  <p>
    Maybe the FIA needs to let the teams handle porpoising on their own? Take Red Bull,
    a team who has experienced very little porpoising has dealt with this loss in downforce
    by engineering a new rear suspension that can adjust to the environment once the vehicle
    reaches 250 kph. The ground effect, which is caused by air rushing through a small
    breach in the lowest part of the tunnel to fill the higher-pressure lower area behind,
    is stronger as the car's speed increases as it is drawn closer to the ground.
    The airflow's speed and, thus, the amount of downforce, rise dramatically as the gap
    shrinks to its final few millimetres. So, thanks to their engineers, a team with no
    porpoising issues are now forced to
    change their car design, resulting in slower cars. The FIA needs to let the teams
    try to solve it for themselves.

  <h2>
    What now?
  </h2>

  <p>
    With all these regulations and speculations, it seems that all we can do for
    now, as an enjoyer of F1, is sit back and see how it all unfolds.
    However, one thing is certain: these new regulations will change Formula 1 and how racing competes.
